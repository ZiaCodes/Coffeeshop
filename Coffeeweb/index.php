<h2>Liberica Coffee</h2>
<h5>Liberica is a low yield type of coffee compared to Arabica and Robusta.</h5>
<h3>What Is Liberica Coffee?</h3>
<p>Liberica coffee is a species of coffee plant that was first discovered in Liberia which gives it its name.
It’s a much larger plant/tree than other species, growing to 20m in height and producing coffee beans that are much larger than other varieties.
Liberica is the 3rd most popular coffee for drinking, accounting for 2% of the world’s consumption behind the behemoths of Arabica (about 75%) and Robusta (about 20%).
The coffee it makes is still coffee. It’s brown, it’s inherently bitter and it’s caffeinated, all the things you’ve come to expect from your favorite drink.
It has not entered the consciousness of coffee brewers and roasters in the West, presumably as a consequence of its difficulty to obtain and perhaps its unappealing taste.
Despite this, in certain countries it remains very popular, particularly for its use in cheaper ways of selling coffee such as instant coffee.

<h2>Robusta Coffee</h2>
<h5>This type of coffee, which contains 2.5% more caffeine than other types, has a pretty strong taste.</h5>
<h3>What is Robusta Coffee?</h3>
<p>Robusta coffee is a strong, full-bodied coffee with a unique, earthy flavour. 
It has other distinct attributes – such as higher bitterness and lower acidity. 
Its flavours are bolder and darker, and exhibit a chocolaty note in the brew that’s greatly valued, especially in espressos.
Although there are several Coffea plant species, Robusta is one of the most commonly grown coffees in the world. 
Robusta coffee matures more rapidly, results in higher yields, is easier to grow commercially, and contains more caffeine and antioxidants
than Arabica coffee.The Robusta plant is shallow rooted, and grows into a shrub that flowers irregularly. 
It takes 10-11 months for cherries to ripen and produce oval-shaped Robusta seeds (or beans).
Once the cherries (beans) ripen, they are harvested, processed, milled (i.e. hulled, polished, graded and sorted), 
roasted, ground and finally brewed and consumed

<h2>Arabica Coffee</h2>
<h5>This coffee bean with low caffeine and a smoother taste is aromatic and delicious. 80% of the coffee in the world is produced from these types of beans.</h5>
<h3>What is Arabica Coffee?</h3>
<p>
Arabica coffee is the worlds most popular type of coffee. In this post, we are going to talk about all things arabica – 
then you can decide if it is actually better than robusta.With all the different kinds of coffee beans to choose from 
(not to mention all those wonderful coffee drinks) you may be wondering what arabica coffee is – and how it affects your daily java.
Arabica coffee is a type of coffee made from the beans of the Coffea arabica plant.Arabica originated in the southwestern highlands of 
Ethiopia and is the most popular kind of coffee worldwide – making up 60% or more of coffee production in the world.
Second to arabica in popularity is robusta coffee which is made from the beans of the Coffea canephora plant.
High quality arabica coffee should have a slightly sweet flavor, with hints of chocolate, nuts, and caramel. 
You may also notice hints for fruit and berries. There will be a slight/pleasant acidity, and a little bitterness. 
Cold brewing coffee can help bring out the sweet flavors of arabica even more.
